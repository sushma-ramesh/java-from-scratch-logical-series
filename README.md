Learn Java from scratch by creating custom methods â€“ no inbuilt shortcuts, just pure logic!

# 30 Days of Java â€“ Build Your Own Logic (No Inbuilt Shortcuts!)

Welcome to the **30 Days of Java** self-learning series, designed to take you from absolute beginner to confident project builder. This repository contains **pure logic-based Java code**, where the goal is **not to use inbuilt methods**, but rather to **create your own custom methods and solutions**.

> Learn Java by **thinking like a problem solver**, not just by using libraries.

## Who Is This For?

This series is designed for:

- **Freshers and students** starting with Java
- **Aspiring Java backend developers**
- Anyone preparing for **interviews** or company coding rounds
- Developers who want to understand **how inbuilt methods work internally**
- Curious learners who enjoy building things from scratch

##  What Youâ€™ll Learn

| Week   | Focus                                                   |
|------  |---------------------------------------------------------|
| Week 1 | Java Basics, Logic Building, Custom Math Methods        |
| Week 2 | Build Your Own Arrays, Strings, Sorting, Searching      |
| Week 3 | Manual Data Structures (Stack, Queue, Linked List), OOP |
| Week 4 | Exception Handling, File I/O, Final Projects            |

Every day focuses on **writing your own methods** like `reverseString()`, `sortArray()`, `power()`, `toUpperCase()` etc., without depending on `Collections.sort()`, `Math.pow()`, or similar inbuilt helpers.

##  Day 1: Java Basics â€“ No Inbuilt Shortcuts

| File                     | Description                                         |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `SimpleCalculator.java`  | Custom methods for `add()`, `multiply()`, `power()` |
| `SquarePrinter.java`     | Print square using manual logic                     |
| `MyMathUtils.java`       | Manual `absolute()` method without `Math.abs()`     |

###  Concepts Practiced:
- Java syntax, loops, conditions
- Creating methods
- Manual implementation of math functions

### ðŸ“Œ Sample Output:
->   Addition: 15
->   Multiplication: 12
->    Power: 8
->    Absolute of -10: 10
->    Square of 5 is 25
